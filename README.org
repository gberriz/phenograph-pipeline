* main changes

** fast_tsne

   - now has signature

     fast_tsne(data, no_dims, initial_dims, perplexity, theta, rand_seed)

   - expects to be able to call a version of bh_tsne that supports
     no_dims (see bh_tsne compilation section below)

** includes support for PRNG seeding

** new pipeline directory
   contains automated_analyzer.m, bot.m, and supporting files


* required compilation

** phenograph

   #+begin_src sh
   % cd cyt2/src/3rdparty/jacob/PhenoGraph/Louvain
   % make clean
   % make all
   #+end_src

** bh_tsne

    - clone lvdmaaten/bhtsne

   #+begin_src sh
    % git clone https://github.com/lvdmaaten/bhtsne
   #+end_src

    - follow instructions in bhtsne/README.md for compiling bh_tsne

    - the resulting executable *must* be called either of the following

      - bh_tsne

      - bh_tsne_<ARCH>

      ...where `<ARCH>` is the string returned by the MATLAB
      expression `computer('arch')` for your system.

    - place executable in the directory

   #+begin_src sh
      cyt2/src/3rdparty/bhtsne/
   #+end_src

* setup

  After adding the cyt2 subdirectory to the MATLAB path, run the
  command `setup`.  This command:

  1. updates the MATLAB path to include all cyt2 directories,
     including our pipeline directory;
  2. initializes some global variables.
